Part One

To run the program without a KVM set up:

cd to the folder smebox and type the following at the terminal

$ export FLASK_DEBUG=1
$ export FLASK_CONFIG=development
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ flask run

Part two

To run the program with a KVM set up, you need to enable the connection to Libvirt API, the file that handles the connection is /smebox/fxn.py

fxn.py is imported into the app and used in smebox/app/profile/views.py

Please make the following edits in 4 places to ensure it connects to the KVM

1. Change line 278

stop_status = 1 #fxn.topostop(templateId)

to

stop_status = fxn.topostop(templateId)

2. Change line 180 

domain = 1 #fxn.topostart(templatename,netadminos)

to 
domain = xn.topostart(templatename,netadminos)

3. Change line 185
core_workstations = 1 #fxn.core_workstation_start(templatename,corenodes,coreos)
to
core_workstations = fxn.core_workstation_start(templatename,corenodes,coreos)

4. Change line 189

general_workstations = 1 #fxn.general_workstation_start(generalnodes,generalos)

to
general_workstations = fxn.general_workstation_start(generalnodes,generalos)

Then run the commands in part one above
